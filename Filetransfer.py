#### Filetransfer.py is used to transfer files between two Agave systems and compute, the transfer time using Agave Files API calls
#### File transfer is done between two Agave storage systems, which may have different underlying hosts but are registered with same tenant
#### This script requires following command line arguments
#### arg 1 : Base url for the tenant
#### arg 2:  Authorization token
#### arg 3:  Absolute path of the file to store response time log
#### arg 4:  Agave storage system name from where file transfer will initiate (source), we call it AGAVE_SOURCE_SYSTEM
#### arg 5:  Agave storage system where file will be transfered (destination), we call it AGAVE_DESTINATION_SYSTEM
### Run as : run Filetransfer.py $Base_url $Token $LofFilePath $AgaveSourceSystemName $AgaveDestinationSystemName
#### You will need to install Agave py. Installation details can be found at https://github.com/TACC/agavepy/blob/master/README.rst

### Before we initiate file transfer, we make sure that the test file is uploaded to the source system
### We use Agave file upload call to upload the file to the source system
### If the test file is already present this call can be skipped and this block can be commented
#filePath: The path of the file relative to the userâ€™s default storage location. (string)
